    CONTENT_1 = f"""I want you to act as if you are a linguist who are familiar with functional language which is meta discourse and not the content itself. Phrases in functional language typically appear at the beginning of a sentence, are high in frequency with common and general words.

Here are 12 types of rhetorical functions and their examples.

{rhetorical_functions}

Do the following steps:
Let's do it step by step.

Step1. Read the following article and identify the word or phrases realizing rhetorical functions for each sentence.
Notice:
    1. Phrases should use less than 5 words.
    2. A sentence may have no phrase using rhetorical function.
    3. A sentence may have two or more phrases using rhetorical functions.

Step2. Mark each identified phrase with square brackets (i.e., "[-", "-]"), and then insert the corresponding rhetorical function with curly brackets  (i.e., "{{+", "+}}") right before each phrase.
For example:
Input: After the election, we asked whether the parties should change their leaders, their policies, or both. In addition, we asked about voting preferences.
Output: After the election, we asked whether the parties should change their leaders, their policies, or both. {{+A. Adding Information+}} [-In addition,-] we asked about voting preferences."""
